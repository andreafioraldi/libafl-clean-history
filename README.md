# LibAFL, the fuzzer library.

Advanced Fuzzing Library - Slot your own Fuzzers together and extend their features, using Rust.

## Example usages

We collect example fuzzers in `./fuzzers`.
The best-tested fuzzer is `./fuzzers/libfuzzer_libpng`, a clone of libfuzzer using libafl for a libpng harness.
